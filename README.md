# runescape-launcher-spec
Rpm package scripts for the Runescape NXT client for Fedora.

RuneScape is a massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) created 
by Jagex Ltd.. Their Linux client allows you to play the game natively also in 
Ubuntu. The Fedora rpm is created from the Ubuntu package with a few extra 
libraries that are privately installed. They don't interfere with the rest of 
the system.

A pre-built client for Fedora is available in a repo at 
https://johanh.net/runescape.html

The repository is private and is not affiliated with Fedora or Jagex in any 
way.
