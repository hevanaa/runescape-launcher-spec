RuneScape is a massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) created 
by Jagex Ltd.. Their Linux client allows you to play the game natively also in 
Ubuntu. The Fedora rpm is repackaged from the Ubuntu package. 

A pre-built rpm for Fedora is available in a repo at 
https://johanh.net/runescape.html

The repository is private and is not affiliated with Fedora or Jagex in any 
way.
